In order to setup this proof of concept correctly please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have docker desktop, docker command line tools, and docker compose installed for windows.
2. SQL Server 2016 is installed
3. Conductor is installed
4. You have set the database.hostname IP address in connector-setup.json to your local IP 
   (This is so the docker container knows how to communicate with the host machine running SQL server)
   (Refer to claims-json-config.png)
5. Right click on the startbridgepoc.bat batch file in the windows file explorer and run as administrator

To run this proof of concept:

1. Launch Conductor and connect to:
    - bootstrap: localhost:29092
    - schema registry: http://localhost:8081
    - kafka connect: http://localhost:8083
2. In Conductor create new topic using the name "CIMSTEST.Test"
3. Create a new schema called "CIMSTEST.Test-value" and use this schema:

{
  "type" : "record",
  "name" : "ClaimBlackList",
  "namespace" : "Test",
  "fields" : [ {
    "name" : "UserID",
    "type" : "string",
    "default" : ""
  }, {
    "name" : "CO_ContractID",
    "type" : "int",
    "default" : 0
  }, {
    "name" : "LastUpdate_before",
    "type" : "long",
    "default" : 0
  }, {
    "name" : "IsIndividual_before",
    "type" : "boolean"
  }, {
    "name" : "LastUpdate_after",
    "type" : "long",
    "default" : 0
  }, {
    "name" : "IsIndividual_after",
    "type" : "boolean"
  } ]
}

4. Create a new consumer from the CIMSTEST.Test topic starting from now -> forever
5. Open the BridgePOC folder in IntelliJ and run the MainApp Class
6. Open blacklist-change.sql in SQL Server and hit f5 a few times
7. Watch messages appear detailing the changes in this CIMSTEST.Test topic
